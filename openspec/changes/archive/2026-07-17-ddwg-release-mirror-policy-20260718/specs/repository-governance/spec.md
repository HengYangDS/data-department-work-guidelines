# DDWG accepted-to-release mirror policy specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Accepted-to-release fast-forward mirror

The documentation adopter SHALL configure `main` as the fast-forward mirror of
accepted `dev`. Only a governed accepted-root closeout of a proved
`candidate/dev` SHA SHALL advance either protected branch; that closeout SHALL
leave `main` and `dev` at the same SHA.

#### Scenario: Proven candidate closes into accepted and release branches

- **WHEN** an exact-HEAD local proof has passed for `candidate/dev`
- **AND** `main` is not ahead of accepted `dev`
- **THEN** governed closeout SHALL fast-forward `dev` and `main` to that SHA

### Requirement: Candidate branch remains local-only

The documentation adopter SHALL treat `candidate/dev` as a local candidate
train. GitLab and GitHub publication projections SHALL NOT receive
`candidate/dev`; only `dev`, `main`, and `submit/*` are eligible for remote
projection.

#### Scenario: Local candidate proof is not publication evidence

- **WHEN** candidate validation or accepted closeout completes locally
- **THEN** the result SHALL NOT assert a GitLab or GitHub push
